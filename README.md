# KalmanFilterCHOP: Real-Time Adaptive Filtering for TouchDesigner

## Introduction

Real-time data streamsâ€”especially in creative coding environments like TouchDesignerâ€”are rarely clean. Whether sourced from sensors, audio, or user input, they often carry noise, latency, or unpredictable spikes. To deal with this chaos, I implemented a fully configurable multi-channel Kalman Filter as a Script CHOP, under the name `kalmanfilter1`.

---

## Motivation

TouchDesigner lacks a built-in, general-purpose, multi-dimensional Kalman filter. I wanted something that can be:

- Drop-in for any multi-channel CHOP input  
- Visual, with full trail history inside the Script CHOP  
- Tunable, with real-time parameter control  
- And most importantly: stable, robust, and fast  

This wasnâ€™t just about filteringâ€”it was about making signal behavior visible and expressive in an environment meant for real-time human interaction.

---

## Justification

Compared to smoothing or lag CHOPs, Kalman filtering offers:

- A probabilistic model: not just smoothing, but estimation  
- Configurable trust in system dynamics (`Q`) vs. measurements (`R`)  
- Support for matrix-based modeling (`A`, `H`), and temporal adaptation (`Î”t`)  
- With some care: speed/slope control, multi-pass refinement, and per-sample filtering  

All of that is now implemented inside `kalmanfilter1`, with a compact parameter UI and an internal state machine that handles reset, reconfiguration, and overflow-safe history tracking.

---

## Tests

I conducted three main tests:

1. **Sine wave test** â€“ classic noisy input with smooth oscillations  
2. **Step response** â€“ abrupt signal jump; tested filter latency and overshoot  
3. **Ramp input** â€“ slow, linear growth; used to examine slope stability and lag  

Each case was evaluated by comparing:

- Raw measurements  
- True ground-truth signal  
- Kalman-filtered output  

We computed RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) between the filtered signal and the true one. Results showed low error, visibly smooth outputs, and preserved dynamics.

---

## Evaluation

The filter tracked both abrupt and slow changes effectively.

### Key outcomes:

- **Step signal:** quick response without overshooting  
- **Ramp signal:** lag-free tracking with strong jitter suppression  
- **Sine:** very low noise bleed-through, even with moderate Q/R  

Additionally, the Script CHOPâ€™s internal trail buffer allowed direct visual feedback without needing external Trail CHOPsâ€”essential for rapid prototyping.

---

## Future Development

Planned improvements:

- Dynamic Q/R adjustment based on signal variance (adaptive Kalman)  
- Optional velocity & acceleration tracking (state vector extension)  
- Multi-filter pipelines (e.g., pre-smoother + Kalman)  
- Exportable presets and OSC/MIDI bindings for live performance  

Eventually, this logic might be rewritten as a C++ CHOP for maximum CPU efficiencyâ€”but `kalmanfilter1` already delivers clear, fast, and flexible results.
